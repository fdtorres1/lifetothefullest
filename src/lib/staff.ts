Certified Integrative Mental Health Professional with expertise in nutritional and integrative medicine for mental health.",
    bio: "I believe that people face many challenges in their lives. I believe that with perseverance and with focus many challenges can be overcome. I believe that it is important to accept things that we may not like; and change our thinking when we cannot change our situation. That is why my approach to treatment is integrative with influences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\nI believe that people often try to avoid or suppress emotions, thoughts, or memories, which may result in unhealthy or maladaptive methods to further that avoidance. Often these symptoms, whether eating disorder behavior, self-injury, chemical dependency, etc., also serve some sort of purpose in the person's life and help them through difficult times in an unhealthy way. The purpose of treatment then becomes to replace ineffective and maladaptive behavior with functional and thoughtful responses. My approach to therapy emphasizes the acceptance and validation of your thoughts, feelings, and actions; while still challenging you to think of alternatives and practice acceptance of discomfort in the service of change.\n\nI specialize in working with adults and adolescents and focus on helping you to identify your values and take action toward the person you would like to be. My role is to help you define your sense of identity and see meaning in your life beyond the daily grind. My role is to help you learn about yourself by challenging your worries and clarifying your values. I work with all ages and diagnoses. I also have specialized training in the areas of eating disorders and sports performance. I am a Certified Integrative Mental Heath Professional (CIMHP) with a focus on nutritional and integrative medicine for mental health.\n\nThough I do practice using primarily the previously mentioned treatment techniques, my ultimate goal is to ensure a positive therapeutic relationship with each and every one of my clients. I am certainly flexible within my treatment approach and hope to work with you in a way that best meets your needs and helps you start living your life to the fullest.",

I know that starting therapy can feel vulnerable, but I want you to know that you're not alone. Therapy isn't just about working through struggles—it's about discovering your strengths, embracing your story, and learning how to live a life that feels fulfilling and authentic. If you're ready to take that next step, I'd be honored to walk this journey with you.",

    bio: "I am passionate about helping individuals of all ages, including children, navigate life's challenges with compassion and empowerment. I provide a warm, non-judgmental space where clients feel seen, heard, and supported on their journey toward healing and growth. My approach is centered on fostering a safe, trusting relationship where you can openly explore your thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nI integrate evidence-based therapies including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and EMDR. These modalities allow us to explore and process emotions, thoughts, and behaviors in a holistic way that is aligned with your unique needs and goals. I believe in meeting each client where they are, empowering them with the tools they need to navigate life's challenges and build resiliency.\n\nIn addition to these therapeutic approaches, I also draw from a strengths-based perspective, which focuses on the inherent strengths you already possess. Together, we will work to uncover and amplify these strengths to help you overcome obstacles and create lasting, positive change in your life. Whether working with children or adults, I believe in fostering a sense of agency and self-efficacy, so that you can feel more in control of your journey.\n\nTrauma-informed care is also at the heart of my practice. I recognize that past experiences shape how we relate to ourselves and others. In our work together, I approach your experiences with deep respect, ensuring a safe and supportive environment that allows for healing at your own pace. I recognize that healing is a process, and I am committed to walking alongside you with patience, empathy, and understanding.",
