    summary: "Integrative therapist specializing in ACT, DBT, and CBT approaches. Works with adults and adolescents on eating disorders, sports performance, and helping clients identify their values to live more meaningful lives. Certified Integrative Mental Health Professional with expertise in nutritional and integrative medicine for mental health.",
    bio: "I believe that people face many challenges in their lives. I believe that with perseverance and with focus many challenges can be overcome. I believe that it is important to accept things that we may not like; and change our thinking when we cannot change our situation. That is why my approach to treatment is integrative with influences from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).\n\nI believe that people often try to avoid or suppress emotions, thoughts, or memories, which may result in unhealthy or maladaptive methods to further that avoidance. Often these symptoms, whether eating disorder behavior, self-injury, chemical dependency, etc., also serve some sort of purpose in the person's life and help them through difficult times in an unhealthy way. The purpose of treatment then becomes to replace ineffective and maladaptive behavior with functional and thoughtful responses. My approach to therapy emphasizes the acceptance and validation of your thoughts, feelings, and actions; while still challenging you to think of alternatives and practice acceptance of discomfort in the service of change.\n\nI specialize in working with adults and adolescents and focus on helping you to identify your values and take action toward the person you would like to be. My role is to help you define your sense of identity and see meaning in your life beyond the daily grind. My role is to help you learn about yourself by challenging your worries and clarifying your values. I work with all ages and diagnoses. I also have specialized training in the areas of eating disorders and sports performance. I am a Certified Integrative Mental Heath Professional (CIMHP) with a focus on nutritional and integrative medicine for mental health.\n\nThough I do practice using primarily the previously mentioned treatment techniques, my ultimate goal is to ensure a positive therapeutic relationship with each and every one of my clients. I am certainly flexible within my treatment approach and hope to work with you in a way that best meets your needs and helps you start living your life to the fullest.",
